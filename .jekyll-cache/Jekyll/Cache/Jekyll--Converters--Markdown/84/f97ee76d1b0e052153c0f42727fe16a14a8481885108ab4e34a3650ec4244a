</a></p>

<h2 id="start">Start</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Do not start a talk with a joke.</li>
  <li>Promise: Tell them what they gonna learn at the end of your talk.</li>
  <li>Cycle: Make your idea repeated many times in order toÃbe completely clear for everyone.</li>
  <li>Distinguish: Make a â€œFenceâ€ around your idea so that it can be distinguished from someone elseâ€™s idea.</li>
  <li>Verbal punctuation â€“ sum up information within your talk some times to make listeners get back on.</li>
  <li>Ask a question - intriguing one</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="place-and-time">Place and Time</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Best time for having a lecture is 11 am. (not too early and not after lunch)</li>
  <li>The place should be well lit.</li>
  <li>The place should be seen and checked before the lecture.</li>
  <li>The place should not be full less than a half, it must be chosen according to the amount of listeners.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>

<h3 id="for-teaching">For teaching</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Board: itâ€™s got graphics, speed, target. Watch your hands! Donâ€™t hold them behind your back, itâ€™s better to keep them straight and use for pointing at the board.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Props: use them in order to make your ideas visual. Visual perception is the most effective way to interact with listeners.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="for-job-talk-exposing-slides">For Job Talk. Exposing, Slides</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Donâ€™t put too many words on a slide. Slides should just reflect what youâ€™re saying, not the other way around. Pictures attracts attention and people start to wait for your explanation â€“ use that tip.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make slide as easy as you can â€“ no title, no distracting pictures, frames, points and so on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not use laser pointer â€“ due to that you lose eye contact with the audience. Instead you can make the arrows just upon a slide.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="informing">Informing</h2>

<p>Show to your listeners your stuff is cool and interesting.
You have to be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>show your vision of that problem</li>
  <li>show that youâ€™ve done particular things (by steps)</li>
</ul>

<p>All of that should be done real quick in no more than 5 min.
Persuade your listeners youâ€™re not a rookie (Prof. Winston contrived to do that from the very first seconds of his talk)</p>

<h2 id="getting-famous">Getting Famous</h2>

<p>If you want to your ideas be remembered youâ€™ve got to have â€œ5 Sâ€</p>

<ul>
  <li>Symbols associate with your ideas (visual perception is the best way to attract attention)</li>
  <li>Slogan (describing your idea)</li>
  <li>Surprise (common fallacy that is no longer true, for instance, just after youâ€™ve told about it)</li>
  <li>Salient Idea (not necessarily important but the one that sticks out)</li>
  <li>Story (how you did it, how it worksâ€¦)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-end">How to End</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Donâ€™t put collaborators at the end, do that at the beginning.</li>
  <li>Questionâ€™s the worst way to end a talk.</li>
  <li>Itâ€™s good to end with a Contribution slide â€“ to sum up everything youâ€™ve told with your OWN decision.</li>
  <li>At the very end you could tell a joke since people then will leave the event feeling fun and thus keep a good memory of your talk.</li>
  <li>â€œThank you (for listening)â€ isnâ€™t good ending, itâ€™s trite at least. You can end with a quote of a prominent person (my own knowledge), with a salute to people how much you valued the time being here, the people over hereâ€¦, â€œIâ€™d like to get back, it was fun!â€</li>
</ul>
